## Pirate Intelligent Agent Project

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I was tasked with developing a pirate intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game using reinforcement learning techniques. I was provided with starter code, including an environment representation in the form of an 8x8 maze and some foundational classes such as `TreasureMaze` and `GameExperience` that represented the game environment and stored episodes respectively. 

The primary task was to implement the deep Q-learning algorithm for the pirate agent. While I was provided with a skeleton structure and pseudocode, I filled in the key logic for training the model. This involved:
- Initializing the environment and parameters.
- Iteratively selecting actions based on exploration or exploitation and observing the results.
- Storing the episodes for experience replay.
- Training a neural network model to improve its policy over time.

#### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing, analyzing, and implementing algorithms. They develop software applications, design computer hardware, and delve into computational theories, ensuring that technology works efficiently and effectively. Their work matters because they drive innovations in various fields, from healthcare and finance to entertainment and transportation. The algorithms and systems designed by computer scientists empower technological advancements, making our lives easier, safer, and more connected.

#### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves systematic analysis, abstraction, and problem-solving. The typical approach includes:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: Clearly defining the problem statement and understanding its constraints.
2. **Design and Planning**: Conceptualizing potential solutions, often using pseudocode or flowcharts.
3. **Implementation**: Coding the solution and ensuring it meets the requirements.
4. **Testing and Debugging**: Ensuring the solution works for various edge cases and refining it if necessary.
5. **Optimization**: Making the solution more efficient in terms of time and space complexity.
6. **Documentation**: Making sure the solution is well-documented for future reference or modifications.

#### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities include:
- **Privacy and Security**: Protecting the end users' data and ensuring any software or system developed is secure from potential breaches.
- **Transparency**: Keeping the end user informed about how their data is used or how an algorithm might impact them.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring that the software or system functions as intended, reducing the risk of errors that could harm users or other stakeholders.
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying updated with the latest in technology to provide the best solutions and advice.
- **Honesty and Integrity**: Providing accurate information and not overpromising on capabilities.
- **Respecting Intellectual Property**: Not using others' work without proper acknowledgment or permission.
- **Considering Societal Impact**: Being aware of the broader implications of technological solutions, including potential biases in algorithms, and working towards equitable solutions.
